<!--[**Note:** This template is provided to give you a good idea about the kind of information you should include in a README.md file as a best practice. You know your project inside-out. Write your readme file for someone who doesn't know anything about it. What do you want people to know about your project who are just coming across it for the first time? OASIS Staff are happy to collaborate with you as well.

You may copy and edit this template as you see fit for your project and your community. You are also welcome to use emojis, graphics or images in your README. This file should be reviewed regularly and kept up-to-date.]-->


## CoSAI Workstream 3: AI Security Risk Governance

This repository is for the work of the CoSAI Workstream 3, AI Risk Governance. CoSAI is an [OASIS Open Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/) and an open ecosystem of AI and security experts from industry leading organizations dedicated to sharing best practices for secure AI deployment and collaborating on AI security research and product development. For more information on CoSAI, please visit the [CoSAI website](https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/) and the [Open Project repository](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project) which has information governance and the project charter.

### About this workstream
The goal of this workstream is to develop a security-focused risk and controls taxonomy, checklist, and scorecard to guide practitioners in readiness assessments, management, monitoring, and reporting of their AI products, services, and components. Further information can be found [here](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/WORKSTREAMS.md).

### Workstream Leads
* David Kliemann, IBM
* David LaBianca, Google

<!--## Badges [optional – TBD]

Using badges is optional, but they are a nice way to show some key facts and stats about your project at a glance. There are badges for all kinds of things relating to your repository, e.g. to show the license you're using, the programming language, the number of forks, or a CI badge to show build/test status. Be mindful not to use too many badges. You can use [Shields](http://shields.io/) to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge. Check out the README of the Open Cybersecurity Alliance project [Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) to see badges in action.

## Description -TBD

* State what problem(s) your project solves.
* Note its development status.
* List the most useful/innovative/noteworthy features.
* Note and briefly describe any key concepts (technical,  philosophical, or both) important to the user’s understanding.
* Link to any supplementary blog posts or project main pages.
* Compare/contrast your project with other, similar projects so the user knows how it is different from those projects.
* Highlight the technical concepts that your project demonstrates or supports. Keep it very brief.
* If available, include screenshots and demo videos.

## Repository Organization (What's Here?) - TBD

You can use this section to give a brief overview of what can be found in this repository, e.g. documentation, meeting minutes, or templates. A good example of this can be found in the README of the [OASIS OpenC2 TC repository](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/README.md).
Please make sure to update it on a regular basis – when new files or folder are added to the repository.-->

## Description

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, with organizations increasingly integrating AI systems into critical decision-making processes and infrastructure. While AI offers immense potential for efficiency and innovation, it also introduces a complex set of security risks that require proactive governance and risk management strategies. 

As AI systems becomes more fundamental to organization execution and success the potential impacts of security breaches, data poisoning, model evasion, adversarial attacks, and system vulnerabilities grow exponentially. Existing, classical security frameworks and standards provide organizations with a blueprint for deploying secure technical infrastructures but they do not fully address the unique challenges posed by AI systems. Addressing these challenges necessitates both the extension of traditional frameworks and standards to cover AI system control requirements and the development of specialized AI system security risk governance solutions.

[CoSAI's Workstream 3: AI Security Risk Governance](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/ws3-ai-risk-governance) aims to provide organizations with the critical insights and tools needed to navigate this complex landscape. Our goal is to enable security teams and technology leadership to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with AI system integration and deployment, while also aligning with emerging AI sysetm security standards and regulatory security requirements.

### Key Areas of Focus

Our aim is to equip organizations with the knowledge, tools, and strategies required to manage their current and future security-related AI system risks. To achieve this aim, this workstream will focus on:

* Approaches and tools to enable organizations to effectively identify and assess AI system security risks  
* Develop and/or extend security risk governance frameworks to address AI system challenges
* Provide guidance and best practices enabling organizations to prioritize security risk mitigation investments related to AI system security
* Partner and collaborate with the larger ecosystem to provide solid technical guidance to inform emerging AI regulations, standards, and best practices
